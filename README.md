# Kingsman E-commerce Website

This project is about creating an eCommerce website for our menswear company KingsMan. The simple interface allows users to click through the pages with ease. In this project, we have considered the different groups of users of this website - the customer, the employee, and the admin. Therefore, we have built different views for each group that presents suitable information to them, including a dashboard to organise the data. This project allows unregistered users to be able to browse the website and view the products, for logged-in users to add items to the cart, place the order, and view orders on the customer dashboard, for employees to be able to manage stock and orders, and for admin to be able to add products to the inventory management system.
