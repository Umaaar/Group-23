                        Please note, we ask that you allow up to 14 days for your package to be delivered 
                        before contacting us to open a lost box claim. For Faster shipping, our Expedited shipping rates 
                        vary based on weight, mailing address, desired delivery date. Please note, while most packages do

                        delivery on the estimated date shown during checkout.
